	<div class="letter right">
	<div class="special">You seem pretty chill</div><p>I've been meaning to look you up for some while now, I've seen friends of mine sharing projects on you for some time and I just thought it was about time I reached out. You appear to be a place where people can edit each other's work, and you can have a place to store all of your work and see when it was edited and which projects you've spent the most time on. </p>

	

	<div class="special">You seem easy. </div> <p>Not in a bad way, but you seem like something with a simple enough procedure to follow without problems. By simply opening up the terminal and initializing the local directory as a git repository with the git init command and a git add README.me, we can then easily add files to this repo. Then we do our first commit with a git commit -m "first commit" .</p>
	

	<div class="special">Continuing,</div> <p>We take the remote repository URL and paste it in the terminal using git remote add origin url. Then we git push-u origin master, that female dog and use git push to finish the job </p>
	

	<div class="special">And after all of this,</div> <p>We have liftoff. So really, at the end of this, I just thought I'd reach out and say that I thought you were super chill.  </p>
	
	

	<div class="special">With love,</div> <p>Your Secret Admirer </p>
