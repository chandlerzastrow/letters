	<div class="letter right">
	<div class="special">I hate you so much.</div><p>Your complexities are something that would vex even the smartest and most intelligent of men. You have so many options that I have to remember. Don't believe me? Let me lay out. </p>


	<div class="special">To get started </div> <p>I start things off with a git init (hey, that rhymes.) Then with git add and git add . I can stage files, and as I edit, I can drop a git status to see what's going on with my files. And once I'm happy with what I've done, I can git commit and have those changes I made actually mean something. I now have a note about what was changed. So much complexity! But this is only the beginning!</p>
	

	<div class="special">To continue</div> <p>We can create branches. These are useful for when wanting to try variations of a webpage. These aren't completely permanent, but if I want them to be, I can use a git merge to add it to the master branch, making it a full-scale part of my site! Ok, fine, that's a cool feature, but I still hate you! Hate! </p>
	

	<div class="special">And after all of this,</div> <p>I can check type git log and see a log of all of the different commits and changes that I made in my terminal.  </p>
	

	<div class="special">So,</div> <p>the more that I think about it, most of those features are pretty sick, but that doesn't change my opinion about how your workflow is way to complicated. So, again, I hate you.</p>
