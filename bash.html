	<div class="letter right">
	<div class="specialtext">You are my everything.</div><p>You are so much more than just a built in software on my computer, you are my world. Here are just a few memories for you to read through to remember everything you do for me.</p>


	<div class="specialtext"><p>Remember that one time</p></div><p>I typed cd into your system to find my current directory? Because I do. Not only that, but I remember typing cd~ and cd/ to bring me back to my previous directory and the initial directory page. What a rush. And your talented ability to use ls to show me all of the files in a directory? Simply extraordinary.</p>


	<div class="specialtext"><p>Moving past that,</p></div><p>how on this beautiful I Earth could I forget the time that I typed mkdir into your beautiful, blinking cursor. You made a new directory faster than anything I've ever seen. It was absolutely magnficent. Not only that, but you allowed me to use your touch capability to create a new file, as well as your nano feature to edit said page.</p>
	

	<div class="specialtext"><p>And after all of this,</p></div> <p>you let me take my files and directories and put them on the creative server with a simple ssh command to log me in and an scp to get it onto the server. </p>
	

	<div class="specialtext"><p>Well,</p></div> <p>think over those memories and let me know if you'd every want to get back together. Us being apart makes me want to bash my head against a wall. Alright. Bye now.</p>
	

	<div class="specialtext"><p>Love,</p></div> <p>Your Secret Admirer </p>
